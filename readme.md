# 🔐 Adobe Sign + OpenText xECM Integration
A RESTful API built for orchestrating electronic document signature workflows via Adobe Sign, with full integration to OpenText Content Server (OTCS).  
Exposes endpoints to trigger document signing, monitor status via webhooks, and automate document storage — with full support for OAuth, multiple recipients, and workflow transitions.

## 📌 Purpose

This project enables the sending of documents from OTCS to Adobe Sign for electronic signatures, automatic retrieval of the signed document, and final upload to the correct folder in the Content Server — all via API, with no manual intervention.

---

## 🧱 Architecture

- **Frontend (HTML + JS)**  
  Embedded page within OTCS via WebReport, used as the execution trigger. (A webreport is virtually an HTML page ran inside the main application, with the difference that is supports internal tags and placeholders that are replaced with actual data. If you try and check the HTML, be aware that you'll find these odd non-html stuff.)

- **Backend (Node.js + Express)**  
  Server responsible for:
  - OAuth2 authentication with Adobe Sign (via refresh token)
  - Document download via OTCS API (authenticated via OTDS)
  - Sending documents for signature
  - Asynchronous monitoring via Webhook
  - Automatic upload of the signed PDF to OTCS
  - Secure access with HMAC validation + Basic Auth headers
---

## ⚙️ Features

- 🔁 Continuous integration with Adobe Sign using refresh token
- 📅 Secure download of the original PDF via OTCS API
- ✍️ Supports multiple signers (via Adobe Sign)
- 📡 Webhook to monitor signature status
- 📄 Automatic upload of the signed PDF to the designated folder in OTCS
- 🗒️ Detailed logging (`audit.log`, `error.log`, webhook payloads)
- 🧼 Optional purge of temporary files
- ⛔ Duplicate check: prevents resending the same document to the same recipients within 15 minutes
- 🔒 Signature authentication via HMAC with timestamp (anti-replay)
- 🔐 /auth endpoint protected with Basic Auth to restrict public key access

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Activos-Digitales-xECM-LATAM/adobe-api.git
cd project-name
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure `.env`

Create a `.env` file in the root folder with the following variables:

```env
# Adobe Sign
CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
NGROK_HOST=https://your-endpoint.ngrok.app (optional, you can use any HTTP tunnel or port-forwarded IP)

# OpenText
OTCS_BASE=https://your-content-server/api/v1
OTCS_USER=otds.username
OTCS_PASS=otds.password
```

### 4. Start the server

```bash
node backend.js
```

## 🔀 Webhook

- **Endpoint:** `/webhook`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Content-Type:** `application/json`

Used to:

- Monitor signature events (e.g., `AGREEMENT_COMPLETED`)
- Download signed PDF
- Upload the document to OTCS

## 🧠 Technical Insights

- Uses Adobe Sign OAuth 2.0 with refresh token to avoid frequent re-authentication.
- Replaces public URL method with OTDS authentication for secure, restricted environments.
- Temporarily stores files with optional weekly cleanup.
- All mapping and tracking logic is managed by `agreements.json`, storing recipients and creation dates to avoid duplicate sends.

---

## 🛡️ Security

- No sensitive tokens are exposed on the frontend.
- Passwords and keys are read from the `.env` file.
- Webhook filters out irrelevant events and only processes mapped agreements.

---

## 🧊 Testing

- Compatible with protected documents
- Supports multiple signers

## 🧙‍♂️ Developer

This project was fully built by **Pedro Barone**, from scratch, without external help in the name of Stratesys, allocated on a project for Keralty. 
I was responsible for:

- Designing the API architecture
- Implementing secure OAuth2 authentication (Adobe Sign)
- Integrating with OpenText Content Server (OTCS)
- Building all endpoints and background tasks
- Handling file streaming and asynchronous webhook events
- Logging, error handling, and cleanup routines
- Deployment and environment configuration
